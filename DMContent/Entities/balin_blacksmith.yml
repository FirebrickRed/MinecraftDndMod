# ==================== DM NOTES ====================
dm_notes: |
  Balin is a gruff but fair dwarf blacksmith. He's been crafting weapons and armor for
  adventurers for over 40 years. He has a soft spot for underdogs and may offer discounts
  to young adventurers. He refuses to sell weapons to anyone he suspects might use them
  for evil purposes.

  Personality: Direct, no-nonsense, secretly kind-hearted
  Accent: Scottish dwarf stereotype
  Secret: His finest work (a +2 longsword) was stolen years ago - he'll pay handsomely for its return
