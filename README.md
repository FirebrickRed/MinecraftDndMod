## About the Mod

This mod was created to use Minecraft (loosely) as a virtual tabletop for Dungeons & Dragons. Having struggled to accurately visualize the world in a traditional 2D space, I decided that Minecraft would offer a more immersive and collaborative experienceâ€”especially since all my D&D sessions were remote.

Some of my players (myself included) would occasionally forget how certain mechanics worked in D&D. From that, the idea for this Minecraft mod was born.

## Highlights

- **Character Creation Menu:**  
  Right-clicking on a piece of paper named **"Character Sheet"** opens the character creation menu, built around D&D 5e rules.

- **Step-by-Step Creation:**
  - Choose your **race**
  - Choose your **class**
  - Input your **ability stats**
  - Select your **background**

  All of this is done through custom inventory menus.

- **Equipment & Naming:**
  After character setup, players are prompted via chat to:
  - Choose starting equipment
  - Input a **character name**, which will display as a suffix (since Minecraft doesn't allow renaming the player).

- **Spellcasting System:**
  - If you're a spellcaster, you'll receive a **spell book** to choose which spells your character learns.
  - Currently, the book displays available spells, and selection/confirmation features are in progress.

- **Weapon Mechanics:**
  - Right-clicking with a weapon (e.g., a **dagger loaded from a YAML file**) will display your attack roll modifier:
    - `d20 + proficiency (if proficient) + Dex/Strength`

  A **"Roll for me"** feature is also planned for players without dice.

- **Stat Blocks for NPCs:**
  - Intended for use by the DM in combat situations.
  - Right-clicking an **Armor Stand** (representing an NPC) will fetch their stat block.
  - Currently, stats are displayed in chat; future plans include showing them in a book or other DM-only format.

- **NPC Movement System:**
  - Right-clicking an armor stand with a **stick** moves it to the clicked location.
  - This feature is still in progress and slightly buggy.

## Development Notes

- Not all races and backgrounds are implemented, as the process is repetitive and low-priority for now.
- The mod is a work in progress, with updates coming as features are completed or improved.
